# "Popular Streaming Service"

Not another Netflix clone ðŸ˜…

I've seen a number of "Netflix clone" projects around the internet these days and I couldn't help but notice that most or all of them have neglected to include the animated front-end interactions + features that, in my opinion, make the user experience cool and interesting. Features like:

- Dynamic infinity sliders that don't fully load its contents until it's interacted with.
- Modals that have different appearances depending on which state they're in. I've noticed at least three types of modals: _mini_, _detail_, and _gallery_.
- _Mini_ and _detail_ modals are activated when a slider thumbnail is hovered or clicked or when the "More Info" button is clicked.
- _Gallery_ modals, which are modals within modals that appears after a slider's title link button is clicked. Yikes.

## What's next?

This was mostly intended to be a fun front-end project where I attempted to recreate some of the cool animated interactions as seen on Netflix dot com (as of October 2022) and is not at all close to a minimum viable product, obviously.

At the very least I plan to update React and Next.js to their latest versions and further try and improve the app's overall performance. The app's architecture will likely change over time as well as I find more time to tinker around or implement additional features like the _gallery_ modals.

I also haven't really written any tests up to this point (yeah I know). I did say this was supposed to be a fun project though ðŸ«
